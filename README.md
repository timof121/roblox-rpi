Trying to get roblox working on the raspberry pi (raspbian os, not android)

If want to install x86 wine on raspberyr pi, you can use [Pi-Apps](https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps)

Currently focusing on studio.

welp i think roblox changed the requieremnts to run, and im facing an issue tat roblox will only work on wine 6.11+ BUT its unstalbr on box86 so both player and studio freeze

# Current progress: 2%
